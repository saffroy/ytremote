We want to build a small web app in python+js.

The app has 3 pages:

- a landing page gives a choice to go to a control page or a view page

- the view page connects back to the backend and awaits commands over
  ws: commands can have the page create a youtube video player, start
  playing, pausing, adjusting volume, switch to a new video, etc.

- the control page also connects to the backend, and lets the user
  send commands to other browsers connected on the view page, using
  buttons (play/pause), a slider (volume), a text field (youtube video
  url)

The backend serves the static pages and creates a websocket server to
broadcast commands from a control client to the view clients.

For the backend, use flask and simple-websocket. For the pages, use
plain javascript.
